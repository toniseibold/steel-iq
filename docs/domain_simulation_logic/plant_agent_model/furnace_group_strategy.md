# Furnace Group Strategy Documentation

## Overview

The technology strategy system for furnace groups operates through a two-function architecture that separates **economic analysis** from **strategic decision-making**:

### Economic Analysis Engine: `optimal_technology_name()`
The `optimal_technology_name` function in the `FurnaceGroup` class is a critical economic analysis component that evaluates the financial viability of technology transitions in steel production facilities. It is a pure analytical function that returns economic metrics without making decisions or modifying any state. It performs a comprehensive Net Present Value (NPV) analysis by:
- Calculating the Cost of Stranded Assets (COSA) for abandoning current technology
- Evaluating NPV for each allowed technology transition
- Accounting for subsidies, carbon costs, and operational differences
- Comparing greenfield (new) vs brownfield (retrofit) installations

### Strategic Decision Orchestrator: `evaluate_furnace_group_strategy()`
The `evaluate_furnace_group_strategy` function in the `Plant` class is the strategic decision-maker that uses NPV analysis to make investment decisions, thereby modifying the state of furnace groups. It:
- Calls `optimal_technology_name()` to obtain economic analysis
- Applies business logic (affordability checks, capacity limits, risk assessment)
- Makes strategic decisions based on economic and operational constraints
- Generates actionable commands (renovate, switch technologies, or close facilities)
- Updates plant balance sheets to reflect investment costs

## Detailed Stage Breakdown

### Stage 1: Initialize and Import Dependencies
- **Purpose**: Set up logging and import required calculation functions
- **Debug prefix**: `[OPTIMAL TECHNOLOGY]:`
- **Key actions**:
  - Log current furnace group state
  - Import cost and emissions calculation functions
  - Initialize return dictionaries

### Stage 2: Prepare Operating Expenses List and Calculate Operating Subsidies
- **Purpose**: Apply OPEX subsidies to the current OPEX value
- **Output**: List of subsidised OPEX values by year for the period of remaining lifetime

### Stage 3: Calculate Carbon Costs for Current Technology and Combine with Subsidised OPEX
- **Purpose**: Determine carbon cost series for existing operations
- **Key decision**: Use current emissions and chosen boundary
- **Inputs**: Current emissions, carbon price series, emission boundary
- **Output**: List of carbon costs over facility lifetime combined with list of subsidised OPEX values

### Stage 4: Calculate Cost of Stranded Assets (COSA)
- **Purpose**: Determine the cost of abandoning current technology
- **Key calculation**: NPV of the foregone operating margin (discounted gross cash flow over the remaining life)
- **Rationale**: Remaining debt is excluded — it persists via the `legacy_debt_schedule` (realised P&L / closure), so it cancels from the switch-vs-stay comparison

### Stage 5: Check for Allowed Technology Transitions
- **Decision point**: Are transitions defined for current technology?
  - If no: Return empty results (no switch possible)
  - If yes: Continue to evaluation
- **Key check**: `allowed_furnace_transitions` dictionary

### Stage 6: Evaluate Each Allowed Technology
- **For each technology in allowed transitions**:
  - **Decision 1**: Does technology have capex data?
    - If no: Skip this technology
  - **Decision 2**: Special requirements check
    - BOF requires smelter furnace
    - If not met: Skip this technology

### Stage 7: Branch Based on Technology Type

#### Branch A: Current Technology (Brownfield)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Retrofit of existing facility
  - Reduced capex (typically 20% of greenfield)
  - Uses existing BOM and utilization rate
  - Uses existing emissions profile
- **Key adjustments**:
  - Apply brownfield_capex_share multiplier
  - Validate existing BOM structure

#### Branch B: New Technology (Greenfield)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Complete replacement with new technology
  - Full capex cost
  - Requires fetching average BOM
  - Must calculate new emissions profile
- **Process**:
  1. Fetch average BOM for technology
  2. Match business cases with BOM
  3. Calculate emissions for new technology
  4. Determine carbon costs based on new emissions

### Stage 8: Calculate NPV
- **Prerequisite**: Valid BOM must exist
- **Process**:
  1. Store BOM for technology
  2. Get market price for product type
  3. Calculate operating subsidies
  4. Apply capex subsidies
  5. Calculate secondary output adjustment (by-product revenue/cost from `output_energy_costs`)
  6. Calculate full NPV including:
     - Capex (after subsidies)
     - Operating costs and revenues
     - Carbon costs
     - Debt service
     - Secondary output adjustment (constant snapshot from current year, applied during operational years only)
- **Key parameters**: Capacity, utilization, lifetime, financing costs
- **Note**: Secondary output adjustment is included in NPV for both brownfield (renovation) and greenfield (technology switch) paths, as well as COSA baseline. This captures by-product revenue (e.g., bf_gas, bof_gas, cog, ironmaking_slag), disposal costs (e.g., steelmaking_slag — see `disposal_cost_outputs` in SimulationConfig), and carbon output costs (e.g., co2_stored) in investment decisions.
- **Construction-year alignment**: `calculate_npv_full` lags the secondary-output adjustment with `zeros` of length `construction_time` so it only contributes during operational years. Earlier code applied the constant to every year of the cash-flow series, including construction — that double-counted upcoming by-product revenue against capex, biasing greenfield NPVs upward.
- **Greenfield BOM shape**: `Environment.get_bom_from_avg_boms()` produces the BOM dict consumed by `calculate_variable_opex()` on the greenfield path. Each `materials[<feedstock>]` entry must include `total_material_cost` and each `energy[<carrier>]` entry must include `product_volume`; without these keys VOPEX silently collapsed and greenfield NPV was undervalued.
- **Average-BOM cost basis**: fleet-derived `avg_boms` entries carry `unit_cost` per tonne of *input* (`cost_sum / demand_sum` in `generate_average_boms()`), and `get_bom_from_avg_boms()` charges them as `unit_cost × input demand`. Technologies with no active furnace group anywhere get a placeholder instead: their whole default metallic charge priced at the fallback material cost, which is authored per tonne of *product* (USD/t HM). Placeholder entries are marked `cost_basis="per_output"` and charged on output volume, so the bill per tonne of product equals the authored value; previously they were charged per input tonne, overbilling undeployed technologies by the ore ratio (~1.5×). Material `demand` always carries the physical input tonnage regardless of basis. Placeholder technologies also ride a hardcoded 0.6 utilisation (deliberately conservative) and the flat fallback number carries no transport or tariff component (destination unknown before a site exists).

### Stage 9: Adjust NPV for COSA
- **Decision**: Is this a technology switch?
  - If yes (tech != current): Subtract COSA from NPV
  - If no (same tech): No COSA adjustment
- **Rationale**: Switching technologies incurs stranded asset cost

### Stage 10: Return Results
- **Outputs**:
  1. `npv_dict`: NPV values for each technology (COSA-adjusted)
  2. `npv_capex_dict`: Effective capex after subsidies
  3. `cosa`: Cost of Stranded Assets value
  4. `bom_dict`: Bill of Materials for each technology

# Part 2: Strategic Decision-Making

## Overview

**Function**: `Plant.evaluate_furnace_group_strategy`

**Purpose**: Strategic decision orchestrator that uses NPV analysis to make investment decisions

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Makes decisions** - determines which action to take
- **Has side effects** - updates plant balance sheet
- **Business logic** - applies affordability checks, capacity limits, probabilistic adoption
- **Command generation** - returns executable commands for the simulation

**Decision Workflow**

The function follows a 13-stage workflow from pre-flight checks through command generation:

```
Stage 1-4: Pre-Flight Checks
  ├─> Plant financial health
  ├─> Furnace group status
  ├─> Forced closure evaluation
  └─> Technology transition filtering

Stage 5: Economic Analysis
  └─> Call optimal_technology_name() → Get NPV analysis

Stage 6-8: Results Analysis
  ├─> Check profitability (any NPV > 0?)
  ├─> Identify optimal technology
  └─> Technology selection (weighted random or deterministic)

Stage 9-10: Decision Execution
  ├─> Renovation path (if best tech = current tech)
  └─> Technology switch path (if best tech ≠ current tech)

Stage 11-13: Final Checks & Command Generation
  ├─> Probabilistic adoption filter
  ├─> Capacity limit enforcement
  └─> Generate command (Renovate/Switch/Close/None)
```

## Detailed Stage Breakdown

Affordability is checked per-capex at the point of decision against
``plant_group.balance`` (renovation in Stage 8, switch in Stage 9). A negative
group balance does not short-circuit evaluation; the historic-loss closure
threshold in Stage 2 runs unconditionally.

### Stage 1: Check Furnace Group Status
**Decision**: Is the furnace group eligible for strategy evaluation?
- **Check**: Status is not "operating pre-retirement"
- **If pre-retirement**: Return `None` (already scheduled to close)
- **Rationale**: Don't invest in facilities about to close

### Stage 3: Check for Forced Closure
**Decision**: Have accumulated losses exceeded write-off threshold?
- **Threshold calculation**: `CAPEX × capacity`
- **Check**: `furnace_group.historic_balance < -threshold`
- **If exceeded**: Return `CloseFurnaceGroup` command
- **Rationale**: Losses too great - better to close than continue operating

**Example**:
- CAPEX: $800/tonne
- Capacity: 5,000,000 tonnes (5 Mt)
- Threshold: -$4,000,000,000
- Historic balance: -$4,500,000,000 → **Close**

### Stage 4: Filter Allowed Technology Transitions
**Purpose**: Narrow down technology options based on what's allowed in the current year
- **Process**: Intersect `allowed_techs[current_year]` with `allowed_furnace_transitions[current_tech]`, then apply the **P2 CO2 storage gate** to drop CCS candidates the country cannot physically support.
- **P2 gate**: For each surviving CCS tech, the gate computes the plant's annual `get_co2_need(tech, capacity, env-wide reductant)` and compares against `get_co2_headroom(iso3, current_year + construction_time)`. If `need > headroom` the tech is dropped so the NPV race in Stage 5 picks the next-best non-CCS alternative naturally. CCU techs have `co2_stored = 0` in BOM and are never dropped.
- **China capacity-replacement gate** (policy-enabled runs, Chinese plants only): for each surviving candidate — the incumbent's renovation option included — the policy's REPLACE hook resolves the capacity the candidate may build *before* its NPV runs. A utilisation gate comes first: a group at or below the utilisation floor for the whole recorded window loses every candidate. Otherwise the permitted capacity is `current / ratio`, 1.5:1 when the new route is emission-intense whatever the old route is (stricter than the source flowchart's old-route-first test, by modelling decision), 1:1 otherwise and always in the exempt provinces. A blocked candidate drops off the menu; a permitted one is valued at its permitted capacity in Stage 5. See [China Capacity-Replacement Policy](../capacity_replacement_policy.md).
- **Example**:
  - Current tech: BF-BOF
  - All possible transitions: [BF-BOF, EAF, DRI-EAF, H2-DRI-EAF, BF+CCS]
  - Allowed in 2030: [BF-BOF, EAF, DRI-EAF, BF+CCS] (H2-DRI-EAF not yet available)
  - Plant in a country with no CO2 storage assessed → P2 drops BF+CCS
  - Filtered transitions: [BF-BOF, EAF, DRI-EAF]

### Stage 5: Calculate NPV for All Technology Options
**Key Action**: Call `furnace_group.optimal_technology_name()` to get economic analysis

**Inputs passed to analysis engine**:
- Market price forecasts
- Technology costs (CAPEX, OPEX, financing)
- Bill of materials function
- Carbon cost projections
- Subsidy configurations

**Outputs received**:
- `tech_npv_dict`: NPV for each technology (already COSA-adjusted)
- `npv_capex_dict`: Subsidized CAPEX for each technology
- `cosa`: Cost of stranded assets
- `bom_dict`: Bills of materials for each technology

### Stage 6: Check if Any Technology Option is Profitable
**Decision**: Is investing worthwhile?
- **Check**: `max(tech_npv_dict.values()) > 0`
- **If all NPVs ≤ 0**: Return `None` (no profitable option exists)
- **Rationale**: Don't invest if all options lose money

### Stage 7: Identify Optimal Technology
**Process**: Find technology with highest NPV
- **Calculation**: `optimal_tech = max(tech_npv_dict, key=tech_npv_dict.get)`
- **Check**: Is current technology already optimal?
  - `is_current_best = (current_tech == optimal_tech)`

### Stage 8: Technology Selection
**Decision Mode**: Weighted random (realistic) or deterministic (pure optimization)

#### If Current Tech is NOT Optimal:
**Weighted Random Selection** (when `probabilistic_agents=True`):
- **Purpose**: Model real-world decision uncertainty and strategic preferences
- **Process**:
  1. Filter out invalid NPVs (NaN, infinite)
  2. Calculate weights: `weight = max(NPV, 0)` (negative NPVs get zero weight)
  3. Randomly select technology with probability ∝ NPV
- **Example**:
  - BF-BOF: NPV = $5M → weight = 5M → 37% selection probability
  - EAF: NPV = $8.5M → weight = 8.5M → 63% selection probability
  - DRI-EAF: NPV = -$1M → weight = 0 → 0% selection probability

**Deterministic Selection** (when `probabilistic_agents=False`):
- Pick the highest-NPV technology from the same filtered candidates (no random draw)

#### If Current Tech IS Optimal:
- **Selection**: Keep current technology

### Stage 9: Handle Renovation Scenario
**Condition**: Best technology = current technology AND lifetime expired

**Decision Path**:
1. **Calculate renovation cost**:
   - CAPEX = subsidized renovation CAPEX from NPV analysis
   - Cost = `CAPEX × capacity × equity_share`

2. **Affordability check**:
   - If `renovation_cost > plant_group.balance` → Return `CloseFurnaceGroup`
   - Rationale: Can't afford to renovate, must close

3. **Execute renovation**:
   - Debit the group treasury: `plant_group.deduct_equity(renovation_cost, reason="renovation")`
   - Return `RenovateFurnaceGroup` command

**Example Calculation**:
- Subsidised renovation CAPEX: $160/tonne
- Capacity: 5 Mt
- Equity share: 30%
- Renovation cost: $160 × 5,000,000 × 0.30 = $240,000,000
- Plant group balance: $300,000,000 → **Affordable, renovate**

**Capacity policy note**: with China's capacity-replacement policy enabled, a Chinese renovation is a replacement. It runs at the permitted capacity resolved in Stage 4 (an emission-intense renovation shrinks to `capacity / 1.5`), the `RenovateFurnaceGroup` command carries that capacity, and the freed difference is deposited into the retirement-credit pool when the renovation executes.

### Stage 10: Handle Technology Switch Scenario
**Condition**: Best technology ≠ current technology

**Process**:
1. **Calculate switching cost**:
   - CAPEX = subsidized greenfield CAPEX from NPV analysis
   - Cost = `CAPEX × capacity × equity_share`

2. **Affordability check**:
   - If `switch_cost > plant_group.balance` → Return `None`
   - Rationale: Can't afford to switch

3. **Continue to probabilistic adoption** (Stage 11)

**Example Calculation**:
- Subsidised greenfield CAPEX: $650/tonne
- Capacity: 5 Mt
- Equity share: 30%
- Switch cost: $650 × 5,000,000 × 0.30 = $975,000,000
- Plant group balance: $1,200,000,000 → **Affordable, proceed**

**Capacity policy note**: with the policy enabled, a Chinese switch is likewise sized at the permitted capacity from Stage 4. The group shrinks when the scheduled switch executes and the freed difference is deposited into the retirement-credit pool.

### Stage 11: Probabilistic Adoption Decision
**Purpose**: Model real-world hesitation in technology adoption (financing risk, permit delays, market uncertainty)

**Formula**:
```
acceptance_probability = exp(-switch_cost / NPV)
```

**Interpretation**:
- Higher cost relative to benefit → Lower probability
- Cost << NPV → High probability (close to 100%)
- Cost ≈ NPV → Moderate probability (≈37%)
- Cost >> NPV → Low probability (close to 0%)

**Example**:
- Switch cost: $975M
- NPV: $8.5M
- Ratio: 975 / 8.5 = 114.7
- Acceptance probability: exp(-114.7) ≈ 0% (very unlikely)

**Alternative Example** (more favorable):
- Switch cost: $100M
- NPV: $200M
- Ratio: 100 / 200 = 0.5
- Acceptance probability: exp(-0.5) ≈ 61%

**Decision Process**:
1. Calculate acceptance probability
2. Draw random number (0-1)
3. If `random_draw < acceptance_probability` AND furnace has no CCS/CCU → Proceed to Stage 12
4. Otherwise → Return `None` (probabilistic rejection)

**Special Case**: Furnaces with CCS/CCU equipment are never switched (representing significant sunk investment)

### Stage 12: Check Capacity Limits
**Purpose**: Enforce annual capacity expansion limits (supply chain constraints)

**Context**:
- Total annual capacity is limited (default: 100 Mt for both steel and iron)
- Limit is split between:
  - **New plants**: Greenfield facilities (handled by Geospatial Model)
  - **Expansions & switches**: Capacity added to existing plants (handled by PAM)

**Calculation**:
```
total_installed_capacity = installed_capacity_in_year(product)  # All new capacity this year
new_plant_capacity = new_plant_capacity_in_year(product)        # Greenfield only
expansion_and_switch_capacity = total - new_plant_capacity      # Existing plants

if expansion_and_switch_capacity + furnace_capacity > expansion_limit:
    BLOCKED
```

**Example**:
- Product: Steel
- Total expansion limit for steel: 100 Mt/year
- New plant share: 40% → New plant limit: 40 Mt, Expansion/switch limit: 60 Mt
- Current new expansion/switch capacity already installed this year: 55 Mt
- Furnace capacity to switch: 8 Mt
- Total after switch: 55 + 8 = 63 Mt > 60 Mt → **BLOCKED**

**If within limits**: Proceed to Stage 13

### Stage 13: Execute Technology Switch
**Final Actions**:
1. **Debit group treasury**: `plant_group.deduct_equity(switch_cost, reason="switch")`
2. **Generate command**: Return `ChangeFurnaceGroupTechnology`

**Command includes**:
- Technology change details (old → new)

- Technical details (BOM, utilization, capacity)
- Subsidy configurations

- Separating them allows testing economics independently of business rules

### Testability
- Can test NPV calculations without mocking entire decision system
- Can test decision logic with predetermined NPV inputs

### Clarity
- Clear distinction between "what's optimal economically" and "what's feasible practically"
- Makes code easier to understand and maintain

### Flexibility
- Can change decision rules without touching NPV calculations
- Can add new economic factors without changing decision logic


## Key Metrics to Monitor

### Economic Analysis Metrics
1. **COSA vs NPV**: If COSA > NPV, switch is unprofitable
2. **Utilization rates**: Lower utilization reduces NPV
3. **Carbon cost impact**: Rising carbon prices favor cleaner technologies
4. **Subsidy effectiveness**: Track NPV changes with/without subsidies
5. **Brownfield advantage**: Compare brownfield vs greenfield NPVs

### Decision Metrics
1. **Acceptance rate**: % of positive-NPV switches actually executed
2. **Capacity utilization**: How close to annual limits
3. **Rejection reasons**: Categorize why switches don't happen
4. **Technology distribution**: Which technologies are being adopted

### Performance Indicators
1. **Average NPV of executed switches**: Quality of decisions
2. **Renovation vs. switch ratio**: Technology transition pace
3. **Closure rate**: Industry health indicator
4. **Balance sheet health**: Plant financial sustainability
