# PlantGroup.evaluate_expansion() Documentation

## Overview

The `evaluate_expansion` function is a critical decision-making method in the PlantGroup class that evaluates and potentially executes furnace expansion across all plants in a plant group. It performs a comprehensive economic analysis to determine whether adding new production capacity is financially viable.

## Purpose

This function serves as the central expansion decision engine for plant groups, determining:
- Which technology to expand
- At which plant location
- Whether the investment is financially justified
- Whether the plant group has sufficient capital
- Whether capacity limits are respected (PAM share vs new plants)

## Detailed Stage-by-Stage Workflow

### Stage 1: Initialization
- **Purpose**: Set up the evaluation context and log initial state
- **Actions**:
  - Log plant group ID, current year, capacity requirements
  - Log available balance and number of plants
  - Log configuration (probabilistic agents, equity share)
- **Key Variables**: `self.plant_group_id`, `current_year`, `capacity`, `self.balance`

### Stage 2: Evaluate All Expansion Options
- **Purpose**: Calculate NPV for all possible technology expansions across all plants
- **Actions**:
  - Call `evaluate_expansion_options()` to get NPV for each plant-technology combination
  - **Per-(plant, tech) affordability pre-filter**: For each combination, check that the group treasury can cover `capex × capacity × equity_share` before computing NPV. Combinations the group cannot afford are skipped so max-NPV selection picks from affordable candidates only.
  - **P3 CO2 storage gate (pre-NPV)**: For each CCS candidate, the gate computes `get_co2_need_by_name(tech, capacity, reductant)` and compares against `get_co2_headroom(iso3, current_year + construction_time)`. If `need > headroom` the tech is dropped before NPV is computed, so the per-plant NPV race naturally picks the next-best non-CCS alternative (or yields no expansion for that plant). Reductant lookup is two-level (PlantGroup-local first, env fallback) to stay aligned with the downstream `get_bom_from_avg_boms` call — gate and NPV see the same reductant.
  - **China capacity-replacement sizing query (pre-NPV, policy-enabled runs only)**: For each Chinese candidate, the policy's sizing query returns the capacity the route may actually build — the planned capacity, or ÷ 1.5 for an emission-intense route — and the NPV, the equity check and the capacity-limit check all run at that capacity. Pool availability is deliberately not consulted here: a build that lacks credits is refused at commitment (Stage 11), whatever it was worth. See [China Capacity-Replacement Policy](../capacity_replacement_policy.md).
  - Consider regional CAPEX, subsidies, dynamic feedstocks
  - Pass all subsidy information for proper NPV calculation
- **Decision**: Which technologies can be built at which plants?
- **Output**: Dictionary of expansion options with NPV, technology, and CAPEX

### Stage 3: Check If Any Expansion Options Exist
- **Purpose**: Determine if any viable expansion options were found
- **Decision Point**: Are there any expansion options to consider?
- **Actions**:
  - If empty results: Log "no viable options" and return None
  - If options exist: Log all found options and continue
- **Rationale**: No point continuing if no technologies can be expanded

### Stage 4: Select Highest NPV Option
- **Purpose**: Choose the most profitable expansion option
- **Actions**:
  - Find the plant-technology combination with maximum NPV using `max()`
  - Extract plant_id, NPV, technology name, and CAPEX
- **Decision**: Which option provides the best return on investment?
- **Key Variables**: `highest_plant_and_tech`, `npv`, `tech`, `capex`

### Stage 5: Check NPV Profitability
- **Purpose**: Ensure the best option is actually profitable
- **Decision Point**: Is NPV positive and not None?
- **Actions**:
  - If NPV is None or NPV ≤ 0: Return None (no profitable expansion)
  - If NPV > 0: Continue evaluation
- **Rationale**: Only proceed with profitable investments

### Stage 6: Check Balance Sufficiency
- **Purpose**: Verify plant group has sufficient funds for equity portion
- **Calculation**: `equity_needed = capex × capacity × equity_share`
- **Decision Point**: Does plant group have enough balance?
- **Actions**:
  - Compare `self.balance` with `equity_needed`
  - If insufficient: Log shortfall and return None
  - If sufficient: Log success and continue
- **Note**: The debit lands in the ``add_furnace_group_to_plant`` handler via
  ``plant_group.deduct_equity(cmd.equity_needed, reason="expansion")`` once the
  factory has attached the new furnace to the plant.
- **Example**: 2,500 kt capacity × $500/t × 20% equity_share = $250,000 equity needed

### Stage 7: Probabilistic Acceptance
- **Purpose**: Model investment decision uncertainty
- **Calculation**:
  - Probabilistic mode: `probability = exp(-equity_needed / NPV)`
  - Deterministic mode: `probability = 1.0`
- **Actions**:
  - Generate random number [0, 1]
  - If random_draw ≥ acceptance_probability: Reject and return None
  - If random_draw < acceptance_probability: Accept and continue
- **Rationale**: Higher cost relative to benefit = lower acceptance probability

### Stage 8: Check Capacity Limits
- **Purpose**: Ensure expansion respects capacity allocation between PAM and new plants
- **Validation**:
  - Get product type for the technology (iron or steel)
  - Calculate current expansion/switch capacity (total - new plant capacity)
  - Check if adding new capacity would exceed the limit for that product
- **Limits**: Separate limits for iron (`capacity_limit_iron`) and steel (`capacity_limit_steel`)
- **Actions**:
  - If would exceed limit: Log warning and return None
  - If within limit: Continue
- **Key Calculation**: `expansion_and_switch_capacity + capacity ≤ expansion_limit`

### Stage 9: Validate Plant and Location
- **Purpose**: Ensure selected plant exists and has valid location data
- **Validation Checks**:
  - Plant exists in plant group
  - Plant has ISO3 location code
  - ISO3 maps to a valid region
  - Cost of debt data exists for the country
- **Actions**: If any validation fails, log error and return None
- **Key Variables**: `plant`, `plant.location.iso3`, `region`, `cost_of_debt_original`

### Stage 10: Apply Subsidies
- **Purpose**: Reduce effective costs through government incentives
- **Subsidy Types**:
  - Debt subsidies: Reduce cost of borrowing
  - CAPEX subsidies: Reduce upfront investment
  - Energy carrier subsidies: Reduce the carrier prices used to price the candidate's bill of materials
- **Actions**:
  - Get all subsidies for location and technology
  - Filter to only active subsidies using `filter_subsidies_for_year()`: CAPEX and debt at the current year (when they are incurred), energy carriers at the operating start year (`current_year + construction_time`, when the expansion starts consuming them)
  - Calculate adjusted cost of debt using `calculate_debt_with_subsidies()`
  - Calculate adjusted CAPEX using `calculate_capex_with_subsidies()`
- **Key Variables**: `selected_debt_subsidies`, `selected_capex_subsidies`, adjusted `cost_of_debt`, adjusted `capex`

### Stage 11: Create Expansion Command
- **Purpose**: Generate the command to add new furnace group
- **Actions**:
  - Generate furnace group ID: `{plant_id}_new_furnace`
  - Verify technology has product mapping
  - Create AddFurnaceGroup command with all parameters including subsidies
  - Log success message with key details
- **Output**: AddFurnaceGroup command object
- **Key Parameters**:
  - Basic: furnace_group_id, plant_id, technology, capacity, product
  - Financial: equity_needed, npv, capex (with/without subsidy), cost_of_debt (with/without subsidy)
  - Subsidies: capex_subsidies, debt_subsidies lists

**Capacity policy gate (policy-enabled runs, Chinese plant groups only)**: after every check above has passed and before the command is created, the policy's expansion gate withdraws the planned capacity from the retirement-credit pool, oldest credits first, within the credits applicable to the group (its own region's tag in a key province, and only its own credits from the 2028 company cutoff). If the applicable pool cannot cover the withdrawal, the expansion is refused for this year and the method returns `None`. The granted build capacity must equal the sizing query's answer the NPV was taken at; a mismatch raises.

## Side Effects

- **No balance mutation in this function**: The debit is performed by the
  ``add_furnace_group_to_plant`` handler, which calls
  ``plant_group.deduct_equity(cmd.equity_needed, reason="expansion")`` after the
  factory has attached the new furnace to the plant.
- **Command Creation**: Generates AddFurnaceGroup command for message bus processing
- **Logging**: Extensive debug logging throughout the decision process

## Important Notes

1. **Balance is pooled at the plant group**:
   - Both the Stage 2 pre-filter and the Stage 6 gate read ``plant_group.balance``.
     The equity debit lands on the same group wallet; no plant carries an individual balance.
   - A lower-balance plant can still "win" max-NPV within the group — the cost
     is absorbed by the shared treasury, not the plant. This makes sibling plants'
     operational P&L fungible for group-level expansion financing.
   - The pre-filter drops `(plant, tech)` pairs the group cannot afford so max-NPV
     picks from genuinely affordable candidates; Stage 6 is a redundant defensive check.

2. **Capacity Limits**:
   - Separate limits for iron and steel products
   - Distinguishes between PAM expansions/switches and new plant capacity
   - Helps maintain target allocation between brownfield and greenfield development

3. **Probabilistic vs Deterministic**:
   - The `probabilistic_agents` flag fundamentally changes decision behavior
   - Probabilistic uses formula: `exp(-investment_cost / NPV)`
   - Higher cost/benefit ratio results in lower acceptance probability

4. **Subsidy Application**:
   - CAPEX and debt subsidies are filtered to those active in the current year; energy carrier subsidies to those active at the operating start year (`current_year + construction_time`)
   - CAPEX subsidies reduce upfront investment costs
   - Debt subsidies reduce the cost of borrowing
   - Both types are passed to the AddFurnaceGroup command

5. **Technology Constraints**:
   - Technologies must be in the allowed_techs list for the current year
   - Each technology must have a product mapping (iron or steel)

6. **Logging Levels**:
   - Debug level: Detailed stage-by-stage progress
   - Warning level: Capacity limit violations and errors
   - Info level: Successful expansion approvals

7. **Per-ISO3 Indi Plant Groups**:
   - New plants created by the GEO module are routed into their per-country group (`indi_{iso3}`, e.g. `indi_CHN`, `indi_AUS`) **at birth** by the `AddNewBusinessOpportunities` handler. The per-country group is created lazily on first use via `PlantGroupRepository.register_plant_in_group`.
   - The master `indi` plant group is the dispatch point for candidate generation (`identify_new_business_opportunities_4indi`) and remains structurally empty — it never holds plants.
   - Since `evaluate_expansion` runs once per plant group, per-country groups let each country independently expand its new plants (one expansion per country per year, rather than one globally).
   - The construction-to-operating transition (`simulation.py`) iterates all plants regardless of plant group, so routing is unaffected.
   - Plants in indi groups are identified by `parent_gem_id.startswith("indi")` rather than an exact match.
