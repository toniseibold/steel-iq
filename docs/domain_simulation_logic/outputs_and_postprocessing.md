# Outputs and Post-Processing

This page describes the artefacts a simulation produces — in-memory traces during the run, plot files written by `SteelPlotter`, and the post-processed CSVs assembled at the end. The model also writes geospatial statistics (LCOE / LCOH / overbuild factors) per-year and aggregated.

For where individual costs and emissions originate, see [Cost Calculation Functions](plant_agent_model/calculate_costs.md). For how the trade LP feeds these traces, see [Trade Model Overview](trade_model/overview_trade_model.md) and [TM-PAM Connector](plant_agent_model/trade_model_connector.md).

## DataCollector traces

`DataCollector` (`src/steelo/domain/datacollector.py`) is invoked at the end of every simulation year and aggregates per-FG state into in-memory traces consumed by `SteelPlotter` and the post-processor.

| Attribute | Shape | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| `trace_capacity` | `{year: {tech: capacity_t}}` | All active FGs |
| `trace_price` | `{year: {product: price_$/t}}` (incl. `steel`, `iron`, optional `scrap`, `iron_weighted_avg`) | `Environment.cost_curve` |
| `trace_production` | `{year: total_t}` | All active FGs |
| `trace_production_by_product` | `{year: {iron|steel: tonnes}}` | Active FGs (collected alongside emissions) |
| `trace_utilisation_rate` | `{year: {fg_id: rate}}` | Active FGs |
| `trace_capex` | `{year: {tech: {iso3: capex_usd}}}` | New FGs created that year |
| `trace_emissions` | `{boundary: {year: {tech: {scope: tCO2e}}}}` | Active FGs, **all available boundaries**, scopes `direct_ghg`, `direct_with_biomass_ghg`, `indirect_ghg` |
| `trace_iron_ore` | `{year: {quality: tonnes}}` | Iron-ore allocations |
| `trace_metallic_charges` | `{year: {charge_type: tonnes}}` | Iron-bearing inputs to steelmaking |
| `trace_international_iron_trade` | `{year: {iron_product: tonnes}}` | Cross-ISO3 flows of `IRON_PRODUCTS` from `Allocations.allocations` |

### Emissions reshape and overcounting fix

`trace_emissions` was previously a flat `{year: {tech: total}}` that summed `direct_ghg + direct_with_biomass_ghg + indirect_ghg` for the configured carbon-cost boundary only. That sum double-counted direct emissions — the two direct views are alternatives, not separate scopes — and inflated 2025 totals by ~64%. The current shape stores every available boundary and keeps each scope separate, so:

- charts can be produced per boundary without re-walking the plant graph;
- the chart layer chooses which scopes to combine (e.g. `direct_ghg + indirect_ghg`) without forcing a global decision at collection time;
- the same iteration accumulates `trace_production_by_product` for free, used as the denominator for intensity charts.

### International iron trade

`collect_international_iron_trade(year, trade_allocations)` walks the LP allocations, filters to commodities in `IRON_PRODUCTS`, drops intra-country flows (`from_iso3 == to_iso3`), and accumulates per-product cross-border tonnes. Logged at info level with per-product totals; consumed by `SteelPlotter.plot_international_iron_trade()`.

## SteelPlotter

`SteelPlotter` (`src/steelo/utilities/steeliq_plotter.py`) is the unified plotting class that has progressively replaced the standalone functions in `src/steelo/utilities/plotting.py`. It centralises styling (footers, legends, color schemes), output-path resolution via `PlotPaths`, and per-chart CSV export.

**Class-level conventions:**

- Each plot method takes a `trace_*` dict and an optional `iso3_filter` / region grouping argument.
- Methods return the saved `Path`, or `None` when there is no data.
- `export_csv=True` (the default on most plots) writes a sibling `.csv` alongside the `.png` via `_save_chart_data_to_csv()`. The CSV has the same data the plot was built from — every furnace, every year — so capacity inventory and breakdowns survive even when the chart truncates or aggregates.
- Plot output subdirectory is selected per call (`subdir="plots_dir"`, `"pam_plots_dir"`, etc.) via `_save_figure()`.

**Plot catalogue:**

| Method | Trace consumed | Output subdir |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| `plot_capex_by_technology` | `trace_capex` | `pam_plots_dir` |
| `plot_emissions_by_technology` | `trace_emissions` + `trace_production_by_product` | `EMISSIONS_SUBDIR` (`plots/emissions`) |
| `plot_iron_ore_by_quality` | `trace_iron_ore` | `pam_plots_dir` |
| `plot_metallic_charges` | `trace_metallic_charges` | `pam_plots_dir` |
| `plot_international_iron_trade` | `trace_international_iron_trade` | `pam_plots_dir` |
| `plot_steel_cost_curve` / `plot_cost_curve_per_region` / `plot_cost_curve_for_commodity` / `plot_cost_curve_with_breakdown` / `plot_cost_curve_step` | `Environment.cost_curve` | `COST_CURVES_SUBDIR` (`plots/cost_curves`) |
| `plot_capacity_development_by_technology` / `plot_area_chart_by_region_or_technology` | `trace_capacity` | `pam_plots_dir` |

### Plot folder layout

Emissions and cost-curve plots write to top-level sibling folders rather than under `plots/PAM/…`:

```
output/
  plots/
    PAM/        # plant-agent plots (capacity, capex, charges, prices)
    GEO/        # geospatial / new-plant plots (maps on milestone years; power-price histogram and mine map final-year-only)
    TM/         # trade-model plots
    emissions/  # SteelPlotter.plot_emissions_by_technology
    cost_curves/  # SteelPlotter cost-curve methods
```

Cost-curve filenames follow `cost_curve_{product}_by_{aggregation}_{year}.png` (e.g. `cost_curve_iron_by_region_2025.png`); the legacy ordering `{product}_cost_curve_by_{aggregation}_{year}.png` is no longer produced by the new methods. `plot_cost_curve_with_breakdown` retains its previous filename convention.

## Post-processed CSV columns

`extract_and_process_stored_dataCollection()` in `src/steelo/adapters/dataprocessing/postprocessing/post_process_datacollection.py` assembles a per-FG-per-year DataFrame from the stored pickle data. The column set is no longer hardcoded — keys come from runtime arguments computed once at simulation start.

### Header columns (deterministic order)

| Column | Source |
|--------|--------|
| `iso3` | `Plant.location.iso3` |
| `country` | `iso3_to_country_map[iso3]` |
| `region` | `iso3_to_region_map[iso3]` |
| `year`, `commands`, `materials`, `energy`, `cost_breakdown` | Per-FG state |

Headers are placed first via explicit reordering so downstream consumers can rely on a stable schema.

### Plant fleet age and investment decisions

Each completed run also writes `output/plant_agent_fleet_decisions.csv`, with one row per
active furnace group and simulation year. It is a compact extract of the post-processed
data with identifiers, technology, product, capacity (tonnes/year), status, and:

- `commissioning_year` and `plant_age_years` for the age of the original asset;
- `last_retrofit_year` and `years_since_last_retrofit` for the current investment cycle;
- `commands` and the normalized `investment_decision` (`retrofit_same_technology`,
  `retrofit_technology_switch`, `new_capacity_investment`, `closure`, or `none`);
- `decision_year`, `decision_target_technology`, and `decision_capacity`. For capacity
  additions, `decision_year` retains the year in which the investment was approved even
  though the furnace row first becomes visible after construction is complete.

### Dynamic feedstock / carrier columns

Wide-form columns are emitted for each canonical feedstock or carrier key. Three families share this pattern:

| Family | Key source | Example column |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| `cost_breakdown - <key>` | `Environment.cost_breakdown_keys` (built from dynamic feedstocks via `normalize_energy_key`) | `cost_breakdown - hydrogen` |
| `carbon_breakdown - <feedstock>` | `Environment.carbon_breakdown_columns` | `carbon_breakdown - coal` |
| `unit_subsidy_<carrier>` | `plant.columns[startswith("unit_subsidy_")]` plus a fixed-order header set, then `unit_subsidy_total` | `unit_subsidy_hydrogen` |

The previous hardcoded `STANDARD_COST_BREAKDOWN_COLUMNS` list and the `fluxes` / `lime` → `burnt lime` rename map have been removed; new energy carriers and feedstocks now appear in the post-processed CSV automatically without code edits. Missing keys are zero-padded so the schema is the same across runs.

### Optional columns

| Column | Present when |
|--------|-------------|
| `unit_secondary_output_costs` | FG records secondary-output cost adjustments |
| `unit_carbon_cost` | Carbon-cost calculation produced a value |
| `unit_carbon_cost_contribution - co2_slip` | FG has a non-zero `co2_slip × carbon_price` contribution (calculated on `FurnaceGroup`, collected each year) |
| `emissions_<boundary>_<scope>` | Wide-form columns expanded from per-FG `emissions[boundary][scope]` for every available boundary/scope pair |

### Per-carrier subsidy tracking

The data collector records each FG's per-carrier subsidy (`unit_subsidy_<carrier>`) and a roll-up `unit_subsidy_total`. The post-processor picks these up by prefix, places the fixed-order set first, then appends any additional carriers found at runtime, then `unit_subsidy_total`. This keeps existing dashboards stable while letting new carriers flow through.

---

## Tabular price outputs

`SimulationRunner` writes a per-year price CSV at the end of the run, keyed off `data_collector.trace_price`:

```
output/data/steel_iron_prices.csv
```

Columns: `year`, `steel_price_usd_per_t`, `iron_price_usd_per_t`, optional `scrap_price_usd_per_t`, optional `iron_weighted_avg_cost_usd_per_t`.

A matching matplotlib chart is also produced.

---

## Regional emissions intensity and price analysis

The regional ex-post analysis combines the post-processed furnace table with the
global iron and steel market-price series:

```bash
analyse-regional-emissions-price cluster/results --years 2030 2050
```

It writes `regional_emissions_price_summary/regional_emissions_and_prices.csv`
and one four-panel chart per scenario. Regional GHG intensity is calculated as
the sum of RS-inspired direct and indirect emissions divided by production;
furnace rows repeated for multiple feedstocks are counted once. Regional unit
production cost is production-weighted. Because the model exports one global
market price per product and year rather than regional market prices, each chart
plots regional production cost against emissions intensity and displays the
global market price as a dashed reference line. Bubble size represents regional
production.

---

## Geospatial statistics: LCOE, LCOH, overbuild factors

`src/steelo/adapters/geospatial/geospatial_statistics.py` exports per-country statistics every modelled geospatial year (typically every 5 years where the geospatial pipeline runs):

- `output/data/LCOE/lcoe_stats_{year}.csv` — average / min / max / p10 / p20 / p25 / p50 LCOE in **USD/MWh** plus `n_grid_points`. Source LCOE is the `power_price` variable in `energy_prices` (USD/kWh, multiplied ×1000 on export).
- `output/data/LCOH/lcoh_stats_{year}.csv` — same statistics in **USD/kg** for the `capped_lcoh` variable, plus a `hydrogen_ceiling_pct` column reflecting the configured `GeoConfig` percentile cap.
- `output/data/{factor}_factors/{factor}_stats_{year}.csv` — overbuild-factor statistics (e.g. `solar_factor`, `wind_factor`, `battery_factor`) at LCOE percentile points (`avg`, `min`, `max`, `p10`, `p20`, `p25`, `p50`). Each value is the mean factor across grid points within ±5 % of the LCOE percentile in that country (with a closest-point fallback when the band is empty).

At end-of-run, `aggregate_lcoe_lcoh_statistics(output_dir, start_year, end_year)` concatenates the per-year files into:

- `output/data/LCOE/lcoe_stats_{start_year}_{end_year}.csv`
- `output/data/LCOH/lcoh_stats_{start_year}_{end_year}.csv`

sorted by `(year, country)`, formatted to 4 decimals. Per-year files are kept; aggregated files are recognised and excluded from the next aggregation pass via the `_<digits>` filename suffix check.

## Per-app-run config artefacts

When a simulation is launched from the Django/Electron app, `SimulationRunner` mirrors the CLI output layout by writing two artefacts into the run's output directory:

- `simulation_config.json` — the resolved `SimulationConfig` (after defaults, parameter merges and validation).
- `preparation_metadata.json` — metadata about the data preparation that fed this run (cache hash, source master-input version, etc.).

This makes app runs and CLI runs leave the same on-disk shape, simplifying downstream analysis tooling that walks output directories regardless of how the run was started.
