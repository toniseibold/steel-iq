"""Row packing for the decision-flow Sankey viewer (``decision_flows.html``).

Turns ``<output>/data/pam_motions.csv`` (written by :mod:`steelo.motions` on
every run) into compact motion records. In the viewer, column 1 is each
furnace group's state when it first acts — its technology, or NEW for capacity
that does not exist yet — and every further column is one decision round,
grouped into bands (Renovate, Switch, Retire, Pipeline, Expand, Greenfield)
with technology sub-nodes. Link width is the capacity entering the decision,
in Mt. Years are the motions table's own: the year each motion took effect.

Pipeline motions are capacity that opens during the simulation but was decided
by input data rather than the PAM; like greenfield and expansion they enter
from the NEW state node, into their own band. Closures the input data scheduled
(a group reaching its delivered end of life untouched by the model) stay in the
Retire band; the packed ``src`` lets the viewer state their share.
