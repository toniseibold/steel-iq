"""Tests for the run artefacts: the four CSVs, and the arithmetic they must agree on.

The load-bearing claim is the reconciliation invariant — state(Y) equals the seed
plus every ledger flow stamped up to Y — checked from the written files alone,
because that is how anyone reading a run will check it. The second claim is that
emission is conditional on the binding: a disabled run leaves no policy files at
all, not four empty ones.
