"""Tests that a deferred technology switch books the old technology's debt tail from
decision-time state.

A switch decided in year Y executes in year Y + construction_time, by which point
finalise_iteration may already have replaced the furnace group's lifetime for the new
cycle (boundary-crossing switches). Reading the lifetime at execution then re-amortises
a fresh full-life loan of the old technology; the fix anchors the tail to the
decision-time remaining lifetime carried on the command (``remaining_lifetime``).
