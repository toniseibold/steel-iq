"""Tests for the ③ INCREASE greenfield gate and attribution.

The gate sits in ``FurnaceGroup.track_business_opportunities`` at
considered→announced, beside the G2 CO2 gate whose block-and-retry shape it
copies: a blocked withdrawal returns no command, the opportunity stays
considered and retries next year, and a granted retry consumes on the retry
year. Withdrawals are single-owner — a build can be refused with an ample pool
when no one holder covers it. A grant stashes the withdrawal and the funding
owner on the furnace group; at announced→construction the
``FurnaceGroupAdded`` handler moves the plant into the funding company (group
membership only — ``parent_gem_id`` keeps the GEO pricing paths), with dormant
and unknown owners falling back to ``indi_<iso3>``. Capacities flow in model
tonnes.
